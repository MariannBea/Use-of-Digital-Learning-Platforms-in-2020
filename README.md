# EdTech In the Year of Covid

How did the use of digital platforms change during 2020? This is the question that began this project.

#### Project Description
This project was inspired by a Kaggle Competition sponsored by Learn Platform. Learn platform provided data that it had gathered about the use of Edtech in schools during 2020. It also provided demographic data about each of the districts where they collected data and the platforms that the schools had used. They challenged contestants to use this data along with other information to see what they could find out. There were no specific focuses given for the competition. 

After looking at the data provided and finding other data that was applicable, I chose to investigate these questions:

* Do states with higher student achievement on the 2019 NAEP reading and math assessments have more online engagement in 2020?

* Is there a correlation between a states' technology plan/curriculum content and online engagement?

* Which products are used most in states with higher achievement rates on the 2019 NAEP reading and math assessments?

* Are any district technology development plan features correlated with achievement on the 2019 NAEP at grades 4, 8?

* Are any features of a school's culture correlated with more or less use of Edtech platforms?

* Which programs had the most engagement in each state?

* Is there an increase or a decrease in online product activity during online learning?

* What is the correlation between each demographic factor and engagement with online platforms?

Follow-up for later:  Are high levels of engagement with any particular programs correlated with high levels of achievement on the 2021 NAEP reading and maths assessments?  

##### This project is currently a work in progress. The questions still to be investigated are:

* Are any features of a school's culture correlated with more or less use of Edtech platforms?

* Which programs had the most engagement in each state?

* Is there an increase or a decrease in online product activity during online learning?

* What is the correlation between each demographic factor and engagement with online platforms?

The last three questions will be explored by looking at each state individually and then comparing the results. The 'california' notebook is an example of how this analysis will be done.

##### Getting Started
Clone this repo

__Raw Data__ is being kept [here](https://github.com/MariannBea/Use-of-Digital-Learning-Platforms-in-2020/tree/main/data/raw_data) within this repo.
You can access the data yourself by following the links below:

* [Kaggle Data]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning) 
* [School Culture Data](https://nces.ed.gov/)
* [School Assessment Data]( https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/landing)
* [Data About School Delivery Models](https://www.covidschooldatahub.com/states/illinois)

The school technology plans that were analyzed can be found in [this](https://github.com/MariannBea/Use-of-Digital-Learning-Platforms-in-2020/tree/main/data/raw_data/research/state_tech_plans) folder. I did not save the links of where they were found.

__Notebooks__ are being stored here: [here](https://github.com/MariannBea/Use-of-Digital-Learning-Platforms-in-2020/tree/main/notebooks)
In addition the notebooks, there are four modules stores as .py files stored in this folder. They are necessary to run much of the analysis and process in the notebooks. 

__You will need to install the following packages:__

* requests
* imlearn
* matplotlib
* mlxtend
* mysql
* nltk
* pandas
* plotly
* plotnine
* pymysql
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* sqlalchemy
* wordcloud
